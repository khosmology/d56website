<p></p>Western Washington Area Newsletter is published monthly by:</p>
<p></p>Western Washington Area 72 | 1225 E. Sunset Drive, Suite 145-745, Bellingham, WA 98226| Nonprofit # 794-852</p>

<hr />
<h3>NEWSLETTER POLICY</h3>
<p></p>The Area Newsletter is a communication vehicle serving Western Washington Area 72 (WWA72). The scope includes WWA72 business, i.e. election results, committee appointments, motions, discussion topics, special committee activities, status of WWA72 trusted servants, and content provided by members of the Western Washington fellowship intended to carry the message of AA to the still suffering alcoholic.</p>

<p>The Newsletter also includes a calendar of events, which prominently features a categorized list of the dates and times of Area Service events, and other AA related events occurring throughout the Western Washington fellowship, i.e., campouts, luncheons, and picnics. Fliers related to the above events, registration, contribution, and subscription forms are consolidated in a separate section. Districts’ reports are encouraged.</p>

<p>The Newsletter Editor requests content each month from the WWA72 Committee, in particular elected & appointed officers, standing committees, special committees, Intergroups & Central Service Offices, and the DCMs for each of the 44 districts. All the above are encouraged to submit content that features a method of carrying the message in their sphere of duties.</p>

<p>The author’s first name, at minimum, will accompany all submissions. The Editor reserves the right to edit and/or refuse to publish content considered to be inconsistent with the three legacies: Recovery, Unity, and Service, with particular scrutiny given to content perceived to contain foul language and/or personal attacks.</p>

<p>The Newsletter is intended to be shared with all the members of the Western Washington fellowship and relies on the WWA72 Committee to generate content, overall awareness, and ensure distribution to the groups. It is distributed monthly, free of charge, to WWA72 elected and appointed officers, DCMs, and Alternate DCMs, GSRs of the registered WWA72 groups, past Delegates, GSO, Pacific Region Trustee, reciprocating Pacific Region Newsletter Editors, and the 15 Pacific Region Delegates. Homegroups or individuals may subscribe for $12 per year by sending send their name, address, and payment to the Western Washington Area Treasurer. The views and opinions expressed in the articles and reports are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Newsletter Editor, Western Washington Area 72, or Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>

<h3>RE: PUBLISHING</h3>

<p></p>Publishing & Grapevine Our Big Book, Alcoholics Anonymous, Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, and other books will now be produced jacketless, with jacket images printed on the covers. This change is in response to supply chain disruptions and will help alleviate out-of-stock issues and help keep costs down. Grapevine will be adding a $2.49 increase to all books. The top 10 selling books’ prices will increase on January 1, 2023, and other books’ prices will increase as they go to reprint. Other ancillary items prices will increase on January 1, 2023, as well.</p>
