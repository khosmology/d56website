<h3>NEWSLETTER POLICY</h3>
<p></p>The Area Newsletter is a communication vehicle serving Western Washington Area 72 (WWA72). The scope includes WWA72 business, i.e. election results, committee appointments, motions, discussion topics, special committee activities, status of WWA72 trusted servants, and content provided by members of the Western Washington fellowship intended to carry the message of AA to the still suffering alcoholic.</p>

<p>The Newsletter also includes a calendar of events, which prominently features a categorized list of the dates and times of Area Service events, and other AA related events occurring throughout the Western Washington fellowship, i.e., campouts, luncheons, and picnics. Fliers related to the above events, registration, contribution, and subscription forms are consolidated in a separate section. Districts’ reports are encouraged.</p>

<p>The Newsletter Editor requests content each month from the WWA72 Committee, in particular elected & appointed officers, standing committees, special committees, Intergroups & Central Service Offices, and the DCMs for each of the 44 districts. All the above are encouraged to submit content that features a method of carrying the message in their sphere of duties.</p>

<p>The author’s first name, at minimum, will accompany all submissions. The Editor reserves the right to edit and/or refuse to publish content considered to be inconsistent with the three legacies: Recovery, Unity, and Service, with particular scrutiny given to content perceived to contain foul language and/or personal attacks.</p>

<p>The Newsletter is intended to be shared with all the members of the Western Washington fellowship and relies on the WWA72 Committee to generate content, overall awareness, and ensure distribution to the groups. It is distributed monthly, free of charge, to WWA72 elected and appointed officers, DCMs, and Alternate DCMs, GSRs of the registered WWA72 groups, past Delegates, GSO, Pacific Region Trustee, reciprocating Pacific Region Newsletter Editors, and the 15 Pacific Region Delegates.

<p>Hello Area 72!</p>

<p>I have been busy working with the amazing district and alternate district committee members to schedule the pre-conference assemblies in March. It's so fun to see the fellowship and FUN the neighboring districts are having together.</p>

<p>Around the time this is published I will be starting the pre-conference assemblies around Western Washington and it will be very important for general service representatives to attend!</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of the Pre-Conference:</strong><br>
Is for the Delegate to communicate with the GSRs (and through them the group) about agenda items which will be addressed at the General Service Conference (held in April). This meeting will provide information to help facilitate a discussion within the homegroup.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Conference Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The locations have been determined, and flyers are now available on the Area 72 Events page. I've also attached information.</li>
<li>Keep an eye on the Delegate's Corner page on the Area 72 website—I'll continue adding information about the pre-conferences and other updates throughout the year.</li>
<li>We will have one hybrid and one virtual pre-conference for those unable to attend in person.</li>
<li>Our Central District session on March 23rd will include Spanish interpretation.</li>
<li>The final conference agenda and background materials ARE available. I am post them in a shared Google Drive linked in the Delegate's Corner.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pre-Conference Materials:</strong><br>
A pre-conference packet will be distributed before our first pre-conference via email. Printed copies will also be available. Expect this in early March.</p>

<p><strong>Providing Feedback to Your Delegate (me!):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After you attend a pre-conference, please have a discussion with your group about the topics covered.</li>
<li>Feedback on agenda topics will be collected through a Google Form to streamline submissions. The link will be in the Delegate's Corner and sent via email. However, you are always welcome to reach out via email, text, or phone.</li>
<li>I will be hosting a Share with Your Delegate session on April 12th (zoom) for those who would like to provide verbal group feedback.</li>
<li>All feedback is due by April 13th.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions!<br>

<p><strong>ALTERNATE DELEGATE</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:altdelegate@area72aa.org">altdelegate@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>Greetings Area 72,<br>
The newsletter topic this month is so timely! With the agenda items and background information for the General Service Conference recently released it is a wonderful time to be discussing what it takes to arrive at an informed group conscience. I look forward to reading what others have found as ways to form a group conscience!</p>

<p>In the month of February, I facilitated seven GSR schools. There is one more scheduled for early March and some District Committee Members (DCMs) have reached out, asking me to come to their district or to plan GSR sessions later in April.</p>

<p>These first sessions were intended as a high level crash course for General Service Representatives, Alternate General Service Representatives or members interested in learning about General Service. (Links to the GSR handbook and a useful page on the Area website are listed at the end of my article.)</p>

<p>One of the events that is encouraged for GSRs to attend is a Pre-Conference. (The dates and details of the Pre-Conferences can be found in this newsletter, and on the Area 72 website: <a href="https://area72aa.org/events/category/area-business/pre-conference/list/">https://area72aa.org/events/category/area-business/pre-conference/list/</a>)</p>

<p>At the Pre-Conference meeting you will be provided information and background by our Area 72 Delegate, Courtney S. Then you have the task of sharing the content and informing your home group so you can have a conversation and arrive at a group conscience regarding the topics given.</p>

<p>Groups have many different ways to facilitate this process and each group will find success in their own, different way. Some groups will want to read all the information and discuss all the topics provided by Courtney. Some groups will not be as interested and maybe will only be engaged for a topic or two. Wherever your group falls on that spectrum, the goal remains the same: share information, lead a conversation, share the results of that conversation (thoughts, concerns, questions) with Courtney, so she can be informed as she participates in the forming of a group conscience at the General Service Conference in New York.</p>

<p>I have seen groups have success in a variety of ways, and you can hear specific suggestions from your service sponsor, DCM or you can call me if you're struggling. As your group representative, you know your group the best. I subscribe to the belief that some conversation and some discussions are better than none. Some feedback about the topics will be more helpful to Courtney than none at all. Inform your group of any groundbreaking topics from the Conference agenda and do your best to facilitate a group discussion on however many topics you can.</p>

<p>Through this (Conference) process, your group gets to participate in conversations and decisions that will affect all of A.A. Through this process, your group can "take the final responsibility for their world services" (as Bill wrote in Concept I).</p>

<p>As referenced earlier, to access the GSR handbook, visit: <a href="https://area72aa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GSR-Handbook-P75.2.pdf">https://area72aa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GSR-Handbook-P75.2.pdf</a>. For a "one stop shop" for GSRs go to <a href="https://area72aa.org/gsr">https://area72aa.org/gsr</a>. Both of these are compilations and explanations of things a GSR can expect and what events to attend as a GSR.</p>

<p>As always, please reach out if I can help you, your district or your group. Thank you for the ability to serve Area 72.</p>

<p><strong>CHAIRPERSON</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:chair@area72aa.org">chair@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>Greetings Area 72,</p>

<p>First, I want to thank you all for such a great first newsletter of the new rotation. There were so many great articles. Great job to our area 72 ink slingers! I read the whole thing; part of my new job description. Also, spring is coming. That means PRAASA is right around the corner as are our Delegate Courtney's Pre-Conferences and then the April Quarterly shortly after that. For those unfamiliar with PRAASA, it stands for the Pacific Region A.A. Service Assembly. Some history on PRAASA, it goes back to the 1960s shortly after the 1963 General Service Conference approved the multi-state grouping plan recommended by the 1962 Conference that organized the U.S. into six geographical Regions. Regional Trustees would be elected to the board as Class B Trustees. Shortly after that, this annual assembly was started to prepare the Delegates from the areas in the Pacific Region for the Conference, hence it's in March or every year. Two years ago was my first PRAASA and I was like "meh." After presenting last year and having such a great time, I couldn't wait for this year, I've been all packed and ready for months.</p>

<p>Second, I am excited for the upcoming April Quarterly. I have the Agenda drafted and I am looking forward to hearing an update from the Newsletter ad hoc committee and continuing the discussion. As for the Conference, I am especially interested in the deadline date for Proposed Agenda Items for the 2026 Conference. Are they going to keep it at September 30 or move it into October? Either way, I expect we will want to revisit some alternatives at our July Quarterly as we digest Courtney's report backs from the Conference. Anyway, I continue acclimating into the chair position and have had many conversations with many people since the Quarterly about the Quarterly, Robert's Rules and serving in the chair position to the best of my capabilities.</p>

<p>Third, as for you fellow service nerds, come join me at Seattle Intergroup every first Sunday of the month at 11:00 am for the Service Manual Study where our past Delegates Astri T. and Alan F. lead us through the service manual line by line with robust discussion and Bob F. brings his homemade cookies. Also, come join me every Thursday night at 6:00 pm on zoom for the Pacific Region Service Nerds weekly service meeting. I have the privilege of serving on the committee with some other Area 72 servants and we have a great schedule. Every 1st Thursday an Alternate Delegate from the Pacific Region presents on the Tradition of the month, the 2nd Thursday a Delegate from the Pacific Region shares on the concept of the month, the 3rd Thursday we read the corresponding chapter in the new Service Manual (Month 3 = Chapter 3, and so on) and the 4th Thursday we have a special guest speaker on the Chapter we read form the previous week. For example, when we read the chapter on the General Service Office, we will have a staff member from the General Service Office join us and share their experience working at the office. And if there is a 5th Thursday, we have past Pacific Regional Trustees share their experience, strength and hope in service and on serving as a trustee. Our Past Pacific Regional Trustee Madeleine P. shared with us in January and former General Service Trustee Paul C. from Area 08 San Diego will join us the 5th Thursday in March. For those who have attended past PRAASAs, he is one of the more colorful panelists during the Past Trustee shares on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>And last and as always, please feel free to reach out as I am available to any Intergroup, District or Home Group to share on service and/or personal recovery, to facilitate group or district inventories, or assist in group resolution or just answer random fellowship and/or service-related questions. Just email me as I am always happy to be of service.</p>

<p><strong>ALTERNATE CHAIRPERSON</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:altchair@area72aa.org">altchair@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you know that over the past 7 years, only 38% of districts have had the chance to host an Area Quarterly? Let's change that! Hosting a Quarterly is more than just logistics—it's an opportunity to bring AA members together, ignite excitement for general service, and strengthen fellowship across the Area.</p>

<p>If your district hasn't hosted a Quarterly recently, I encourage you to explore potential meeting facilities that could accommodate 150–175 people. Great starting points include community centers, community colleges, or church fellowship halls. If your district doesn't have a suitable venue, consider partnering with a neighboring district to co-host. This can be a meaningful way to share resources and involve even more members in the process.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to receive two more bids from districts interested in hosting. By hosting an Area Quarterly, we give AA members the gift of service. They might discover something new about general service, feel inspired to get more involved, or form lasting friendships with others on the same journey.</p>

<p>To ensure we have plenty of options to choose from, I've spent time mapping out where quarterlies have been held over the past seven years to guide us:</p>

<p><strong>2018</strong><br>
January: D22 (Port Angeles)<br>
April: D27 (Long Beach)<br>
July: D8 (Olympia)</p>

<p><strong>2019</strong><br>
January: D31 (SeaTac)<br>
April: D29 (Puyallup)<br>
July: D4 (Mount Vernon)</p>

<p><strong>2020</strong><br>
January: D12 (Everett)<br>
April: Zoom<br>
July: Zoom</p>

<p><strong>2021</strong><br>
January, April, July: Zoom</p>

<p><strong>2022</strong><br>
January: D22 (Sequim)<br>
April: D24 (Everett)<br>
July: D9 (Lacey)</p>

<p><strong>2023</strong><br>
January: D15, D40, D41 (Seattle)<br>
April: D45 (Lakewood)<br>
July: D10 (Bremerton)</p>

<p><strong>2024</strong><br>
January: D34 (Bellevue)<br>
April: D57 (Mountlake Terrace)<br>
July: D8 (Lacey)</p>

<p><strong>2025</strong><br>
January: D24 (Lynnwood)<br>
April: D37 (Vancouver)<br>
July: D9 (Tacoma)</p>

<p>Since 2018, 17 districts (38% of our Area) have hosted quarterlies, while 27 districts (62%) haven't yet had the opportunity.<br>
<strong>Hosted (17 districts):</strong> 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 22, 24, 27, 29, 31, 34, 37, 40, 41, 45, 57<br>
<strong>Not Hosted (27 districts):</strong> 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 25, 28, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 46, 54, 55, 56, 58</p>

<p>I've been working with the following districts to prepare 2026 Quarterly bids that will be presented at the April Quarterly:<br>
D21 -- Preparing a bid for Grays Harbor County<br>
D22, D55, and D56 -- Joining forces for a bid in Sequim<br>
D14 and D31 -- Teaming up for a bid in Des Moines<br>
Meeting with these DCMs and Alt DCMs has been a joy. Hosting Area events truly brings love and service into action, proving that we are not a glum lot!</p>

<p>If you're interested in putting together a bid, I'm here to help! We can gather all the necessary information in just a week with a little effort. I'd love to partner with you and your district to spread the love of general service.</p>

<p>And, as an added incentive, I've offered to bake cakes for the districts that submit the first five quarterly bids this year. For those of you who haven't tried my cakes, they're truly delicious!</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
