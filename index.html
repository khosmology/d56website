The scope includes WWA72 business, i.e. election results, committee appointments, motions, discussion topics, special committee activities, status of WWA72 trusted servants, and content provided by members of the Western Washington fellowship intended to carry the message of AA to the still suffering alcoholic.</p>

<p>The Newsletter also includes a calendar of events, which prominently features a categorized list of the dates and times of Area Service events, and other AA related events occurring throughout the Western Washington fellowship, i.e., campouts, luncheons, and picnics. Fliers related to the above events, registration, contribution, and subscription forms are consolidated in a separate section. Districts’ reports are encouraged.</p>

<p>The Newsletter Editor requests content each month from the WWA72 Committee, in particular elected & appointed officers, standing committees, special committees, Intergroups & Central Service Offices, and the DCMs for each of the 44 districts. All the above are encouraged to submit content that features a method of carrying the message in their sphere of duties.</p>

<p>The Newsletter is intended to be shared with all the members of the Western Washington fellowship and relies on the WWA72 Committee to generate content, overall awareness, and ensure distribution to the groups. It is distributed monthly, free of charge, to WWA72 elected and appointed officers, DCMs, and Alternate DCMs, GSRs of the registered WWA72 groups, past Delegates, GSO, Pacific Region Trustee, reciprocating Pacific Region Newsletter Editors, and the 15 Pacific Region Delegates.

<p>Hello Area 72!</p>

<p>I have been busy working with the amazing district and alternate district committee members to schedule the pre-conference assemblies in March. It's so fun to see the fellowship and FUN the neighboring districts are having together.</p>

<p>Around the time this is published I will be starting the pre-conference assemblies around Western Washington and it will be very important for general service representatives to attend!</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of the Pre-Conference:</strong><br>
Is for the Delegate to communicate with the GSRs (and through them the group) about agenda items which will be addressed at the General Service Conference (held in April). This meeting will provide information to help facilitate a discussion within the homegroup.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Conference Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The locations have been determined, and flyers are now available on the Area 72 Events page. I've also attached information.</li>
<li>Keep an eye on the Delegate's Corner page on the Area 72 website—I'll continue adding information about the pre-conferences and other updates throughout the year.</li>
<li>We will have one hybrid and one virtual pre-conference for those unable to attend in person.</li>
<li>Our Central District session on March 23rd will include Spanish interpretation.</li>
<li>The final conference agenda and background materials ARE available. I am post them in a shared Google Drive linked in the Delegate's Corner.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pre-Conference Materials:</strong><br>
A pre-conference packet will be distributed before our first pre-conference via email. Printed copies will also be available. Expect this in early March.</p>

<p><strong>Providing Feedback to Your Delegate (me!):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After you attend a pre-conference, please have a discussion with your group about the topics covered.</li>
<li>Feedback on agenda topics will be collected through a Google Form to streamline submissions. The link will be in the Delegate's Corner and sent via email. However, you are always welcome to reach out via email, text, or phone.</li>
<li>I will be hosting a Share with Your Delegate session on April 12th (zoom) for those who would like to provide verbal group feedback.</li>
<li>All feedback is due by April 13th.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions!<br>
